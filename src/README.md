This directory contains the core files are used to launch the application proper. Further, there are two subdirectories

- `app` - Contains the source code for the application. A README can be found in this directory that explains its structure
- `assets` - Contains various pieces of data used by particular visualisation components. This includes the index file used to navigate the tree structure of the dataset, the data of an initial game to be shown on application startup, aggregate data, and compilations of numeric data points from the dataset for fast access
